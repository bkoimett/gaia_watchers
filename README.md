## 🎯 BloomWatch: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology

Witness the pulse of life across our planet! From season to season and year to year, Earth’s vegetation is constantly changing, providing critical information on plant species, crops, seasonal effects, pollen sources, and changes in plant phenology (the relationship between seasonal changes and climate and biological phenomena in plants). Your challenge is to harness the power of NASA Earth observations to create a dynamic visual tool that displays and/or detects plant blooming events around the globe—just like pollinators do–and that advances solutions for monitoring, predicting, or managing vegetation.

## ⚡The Problem

Across Africa and beyond, farmers plant crops without knowing when blooms will peak. Governments detect droughts only after crops fail. Communities lack access to the environmental data satellites capture daily—data that could transform decision-making from reactive to proactive.

**BloomWatch bridges this gap.**

---

## 💡 What is BloomWatch?

BloomWatch is a **satellite-powered vegetation intelligence platform** that democratizes NASA MODIS Earth observation data, translating complex spectral signatures into clear, actionable insights for those who need them most.

Instead of showing you raw data, we tell you what it _means_:

- 🌱 "Optimal planting window opens in 5 days"
- ⚠️ "Vegetation stress detected—irrigation recommended"
- 📈 "Bloom intensity forecast: 87% peak expected in 2 weeks"
- 🐝 "Prime nectar flow period approaching for beekeepers"

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Data Pipeline**

NASA MODIS Satellite → Vegetation Index Processing → Temporal Analysis →
Anomaly Detection → Predictive Modeling → Intuitive Visualization

**Key Technologies:**

- **NDVI & EVI Calculation**: Measures vegetation health and density
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracks seasonal patterns across years
- **Machine Learning**: Predicts bloom cycles and anomalies
- **Smart Alerts**: Context-aware notifications for agricultural calendars
